## Hi! I'm Ethan! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Game & Web Developer based in Singapore. **Currently looking for work, open to freelancing!**

Here's my [website](https://gnoxnahte.com) for more info ([redesigning the website](https://gnoxnahte.dev), but still WIP).

### Obsidian AutoEmbed

Links: [GitHub](https://github.com/GnoxNahte/obsidian-auto-embed), [Obsidian plugin download](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=auto-embed), [User download graph](https://nevernotmove.github.io/obsidian-stats/plugin/auto-embed)

Obsidian plugin to help embed links automatically instead of using iframes.

Works seamslessly with how [Obsidian implements embeds](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Embed+web+pages), even using the same syntax. Has additional options like setting the size and theme.

### Redesigned Portfolio website (WIP)
Links: [GitHub](https://github.com/GnoxNahte/portfolio-main), [Website](https://gnoxnahte.dev)

Why I want to rebuild the website:
- It was my first website, which resulted in messy code.
- Donâ€™t really like the styles of it, especially the dull colors.
- Want to separate between web dev and game dev. Maybe have different themes for each site? Thinking of web dev being a modern website and game dev be a website with some gaming elements added. Something like: https://bruno-simon.com/

For comparision, my [previous website](https://gnoxnahte.com)
